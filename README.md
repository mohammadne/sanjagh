# Sanjagh

Simple k8s operator to observe deployments.

## Description

Sanjagh aims to demonstrate best practices for how using operators, I tried to keep things as simple as possible and demonstrate how to deploy and structure your operator projects.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

```sh
# initialize base project
operator-sdk init --domain=mohammadne.me --project-name=sanjagh --repo=github.com/mohammadne/sanjagh

# https://book.kubebuilder.io/migration/multi-group.html
operator-sdk edit --multigroup=true

# resource -> generates the api directory
# controller -> generates the controller directory
operator-sdk create api --group=apps --version=v1alpha1 --kind=Executer --controller --resource

operator-sdk create webhook --group apps --version v1alpha1 --kind Executer --programmatic-validation
```

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/sanjagh:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/sanjagh:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
